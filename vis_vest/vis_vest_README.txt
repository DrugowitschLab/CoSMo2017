Drugowitsch et al. (2014) dataset
---------------------------------
Notes by Jan Drugowitsch, July 2017

The vis_vest_[subj_id].mat file contains the behavioral data from the
three-coherence condition of the visual/vestibular cue combination experiment
from Drugowitsch et al. (2014). Optimal multisensory decision-making in a
reaction-time task. eLife, 2014:e03005.

The dataset contains the following vectors, with one element per trial:
- oris: motion orientation in deg, <0 = left, >0 = right from straight-ahead
- mods: modalities present, 1 = visual-only, 2 = vestibular-only, 3 = combined
- cohs: coherence of visual stimulus, one of 0.25, 0.35, 0.7. 0 for vest-only trials
- choice: 0 - "left", 1 - "right"
- rt: reaction time in seconds
